\title{Simulate Multi-Stain Flow Cytometry Data}
\usage{
simulate_cd3(
  x,
  columns = c("FITC-A", "PE-A", "ECD-A", "PC5.5-A", "PC7-A", "APC-A", "AF700-A",
    "AA750-A", "PB-A", "KrO-A")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{columns}{A character vector of marker channels to simulate (default: common 10-color panel).}
}
\value{
A \code{flowSet} of simulated \code{flowFrame} objects, with appropriate \code{markernames()} set
for downstream compatibility (e.g. in MFI extraction functions).
}
\description{
Generates a simulated \code{flowSet} containing single-stained, unstained, and multi-stained FCS-like samples.
Each single-stain sample has signal only in one marker channel; multi-stained and
unstained controls are also included.
}
\details{
This simulated data reflects the data from our CD3 manuscript and is useful for testing.
\itemize{
\item Single-stained files are named \code{sample0_01-CD3-FITC.fcs}, ..., one per marker.
\item Unstained control is named \code{sample0_11-none}.
\item Panel-stained and master-mix controls are named \code{sample0_12-panel} and \code{sample0_15-MasterMix}.
\item All simulated data is random normal noise scaled to synthetic MFI ranges.
