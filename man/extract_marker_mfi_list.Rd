\title{Extract Marker MFIs as Named List for Rescaling}
\usage{
extract_marker_mfi_list(
  sample_to_rescale,
  extracted_mfi,
  column_negative = c("negative", "unstained"),
  column_positive = "positive"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_to_rescale}{A \code{flowFrame} or similar object with marker columns to rescale.}

\item{extracted_mfi}{A tibble with columns: \code{feature}, \code{negative}, \code{positive} (or custom).}

\item{column_negative}{Character vector of acceptable column names for the negative control.
Defaults to \code{c("negative", "unstained")}.}

\item{column_positive}{Name of the column for the positive control. Defaults to \code{"positive"}.}
}
\value{
A named list where each element corresponds to a marker (column) in \code{sample_to_rescale}.
Each list element is a numeric vector of length 2 with names \code{negative} and \code{positive}.
If a column in \code{sample_to_rescale} has no entry in \code{extracted_mfi}, it is filled with \code{NA}.
}
\description{
This function extracts median fluorescence intensities (MFIs) for specified features
from a tibble, returning a named list that maps each feature (e.g., "FITC-A") to a
named numeric vector of its negative and positive control values. If a feature
present in the sample is missing from the MFI table, it is added with \code{NA}.
