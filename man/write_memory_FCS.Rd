\title{Write FCS File to Temporary Memory}
\usage{
write_memory_FCS(ff)
}
\arguments{
\item{ff}{A \href{https://rdrr.io/bioc/flowCore/man/flowFrame-class.html}{\code{flowFrame}} object to be written to a file.}
}
\value{
A character string with the file path to the written FCS file.
}
\description{
Attempts to write a \code{flowFrame} object to a temporary in-memory file.
If writing to \verb{/dev/shm/} fails (e.g., on systems without this memory mount),
the function falls back to a newly created temporary directory on disk.
}
\details{
This function is useful for workflows requiring in-memory processing or
quick temporary storage of FCS files without polluting the working directory.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(flowCore)
ff <- read.FCS("path/to/your/file.fcs")
fcs_path <- write_memory_FCS(ff)
print(fcs_path)
}

}
