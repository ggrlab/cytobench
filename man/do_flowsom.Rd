\title{Run FlowSOM Clustering on a flowFrame}
\usage{
do_flowsom(ff)
}
\arguments{
\item{ff}{A \code{flowFrame} object containing cytometry data that has already been compensated and transformed.}
}
\value{
A \code{FlowSOM} object containing the trained SOM, meta-clusters, and other results.
}
\description{
Performs self-organizing map (SOM) clustering and meta-clustering on a flowFrame using the \code{FlowSOM} package.
This function disables internal compensation, transformation, and scaling, assuming the
input is already preprocessed.
}
\details{
The clustering uses a fixed seed (\code{237123}) for reproducibility. Only selected channels are used for training:
channels 9, 12, and 14 through 18. The SOM grid is set to 7x7 nodes, and the data are grouped into 10 meta-clusters.
}
\examples{
ff <- example_processed()
fsom_result <- do_flowsom(ff)
